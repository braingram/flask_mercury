A flask backend for the mercury editor:

http://jejacks0n.github.com/mercury/


Demo
----
1) clone/download the repo
2) cd to the directory and run: python test.py
3) open a web browser to 127.0.0.1:5000/mercury/test

Saving edited content will create a .json file in a data directory in the same
directory as test.py

When the page is reloaded, if a matching .json file is found (test.json for
template 'test'), it will be loaded and used to render the page.


Snippets
----
Snippets are saved in the 'snippets' subfolder of the template directory.
Each snippet is a directory that contains:

1) options.html (optional)
2) preview.html
3) info.json (optional)

If options.html does not exist, no snippet options will be presented.
info.json can contain the following:
- description: string, describing the snippet
- tags: string, comma-separated snippet tags
- options: boolean, true=snippet has options
    (will throw error if options.html does not exist)


Saving/loading
-----
Saving/loading of content is handled by a 'Store'.
For example see flask_mercury/storage/flatfile.py for a simple flatfile example.

This should be flexible enough to use a mongo backend or something similar.
